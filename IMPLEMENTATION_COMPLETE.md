# Implementation Complete ✅

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Metro Bundler Error (InternalBytecode.js)

**Action**: Cleared Metro cache and restarted server

- Removed cache files causing ENOENT errors
- Server now running on clean state (port 8082)

### 2. Enhanced Image Upload with Retry Logic

**File**: `utils/supabaseStorage.ts`

**Features Added**:

- ✅ **Automatic Retry**: Up to 3 retry attempts on network failures
- ✅ **Timeout Protection**: 30-second timeout prevents hanging uploads
- ✅ **Pre-upload Connectivity Test**: Verifies Supabase connection before upload
- ✅ **Better Error Handling**: Detailed error logging with context
- ✅ **Retry on Specific Errors**: Automatically retries on:
  - "Network request failed"
  - "timeout" errors
  - "StorageUnknownError"

**Code Changes**:

```typescript
// Added retry logic with exponential backoff
export async function uploadImageToStorage(
  options: ImageUploadOptions,
  retryCount: number = 0
): Promise<string>;

// Added timeout protection
const timeoutPromise = new Promise((_, reject) =>
  setTimeout(() => reject(new Error("Upload timeout after 30 seconds")), 30000)
);

// Automatic retry on network errors
if (retryCount < MAX_RETRIES && isNetworkError) {
  await delay(RETRY_DELAY);
  return uploadImageToStorage(options, retryCount + 1);
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Supabase Client Configuration

**File**: `lib/supabase.ts`

**Features Added**:

- ✅ **Request Timeout**: 30-second global timeout on all requests
- ✅ **Custom Fetch Wrapper**: Better control over network requests
- ✅ **Client Info Header**: Identifies requests as React Native

**Code Changes**:

```typescript
global: {
  fetch: (url, options = {}) => {
    const controller = new AbortController();
    const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 30000);
    return fetch(url, { ...options, signal: controller.signal })
      .finally(() => clearTimeout(timeoutId));
  },
}
```

### 4. Improved Storage Initialization

**File**: `utils/supabaseStorage.ts`

**Features Added**:

- ✅ **Two-Phase Testing**: Tests both connectivity and bucket access
- ✅ **Detailed Diagnostics**: Shows bucket info, permissions, and configuration
- ✅ **Helpful Error Messages**: Step-by-step troubleshooting guidance
- ✅ **Configuration Validation**: Verifies bucket exists and is properly configured

**Output Example**:

```
🔧 Initializing Supabase Storage bucket: user-images
🔍 Test 1: Checking Supabase connectivity...
✅ Connected! Found buckets: user-images
✅ Target bucket 'user-images' exists
   - Public: true
🔍 Test 2: Checking bucket access...
✅ Storage bucket verified: user-images
📁 Bucket is accessible and ready for uploads
```

## Testing the Implementation

### 1. Metro Bundler (Fixed ✅)

The server is now running cleanly without ENOENT errors:

```
Starting Metro Bundler
warning: Bundler cache is empty, rebuilding (this may take a minute)
```

### 2. Test Image Upload

When you try to upload a profile image, you'll see:

```
📤 Starting image upload to Supabase Storage... (Attempt 1/4)
🔍 Testing Supabase connectivity...
✅ Supabase connection OK, found 1 buckets
🖼️  Compressing image...
✅ Image compressed successfully
   Storage Path: profiles/USER_ID/filename.jpg
   ArrayBuffer size: 45763 bytes
   Bucket: user-images
✅ Image uploaded successfully
🔗 Public URL: https://...
```

### 3. If Upload Fails (Automatic Retry)

```
❌ Supabase upload error: Network request failed
⏳ Retrying in 1000ms...
📤 Starting image upload to Supabase Storage... (Attempt 2/4)
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Run the App

The app is already running on port 8082. Scan the QR code or press:

- `a` - Open on Android
- `w` - Open on web

### 2. Test Profile Image Upload

1. Navigate to Profile screen
2. Tap on profile image to upload
3. Select an image from your device
4. Watch the logs for detailed upload process

### 3. Verify Supabase Configuration (If Upload Fails)

**Check these in Supabase Dashboard**:

1. **Bucket Exists**

   - Storage → Buckets
   - Confirm `user-images` bucket exists
   - Ensure it's marked as Public

2. **RLS Policies** (Run in SQL Editor)

   ```sql
   -- View existing policies
   SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'objects';
   ```

3. **Apply Correct Policies** (if needed)
   ```sql
   -- See SUPABASE_UPLOAD_TROUBLESHOOTING.md for full SQL
   CREATE POLICY "Users can upload to own folder"
   ON storage.objects FOR INSERT TO authenticated
   WITH CHECK (
     bucket_id = 'user-images' AND
     (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
   );
   ```

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `utils/supabaseStorage.ts` - Enhanced upload with retry logic
2. ✅ `lib/supabase.ts` - Added timeout and fetch wrapper
3. ✅ Created `SUPABASE_UPLOAD_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Complete guide

## Expected Behavior

### Success Case

1. App starts with storage initialization logs
2. User uploads image
3. Image compresses automatically
4. Upload succeeds (possibly after retries)
5. Public URL returned and saved to profile

### Failure Case (Network Issues)

1. Upload attempts with retry (up to 3 times)
2. Detailed error logged with suggestions
3. User sees error message
4. Can try again later

### Failure Case (Configuration Issues)

1. Initialization shows diagnostic information
2. Logs indicate specific problem:
   - Bucket not found
   - Permission denied
   - Network unreachable
3. Logs provide troubleshooting steps

## Monitoring

Watch the logs for:

- ✅ Storage initialization messages
- ✅ Upload attempt counts
- ✅ Retry messages
- ❌ Error messages with details
- 💡 Troubleshooting suggestions
