| ------------------ | ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| Cross-device sync  | ❌ No                   | ✅ Yes                |
| Data persistence   | ⚠️ Can be cleared       | ✅ Cloud backup       |
| Storage limit      | ⚠️ 6-10MB               | ✅ 500MB-8GB          |
| Query capability   | ❌ No                   | ✅ SQL queries        |
| Real-time updates  | ❌ No                   | ✅ Yes                |

## 💡 Implementation Strategy: My Recommendation

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)

**Priority: HIGH** 🔥

- Install Supabase SDK
- Create database schema
- Implement authentication
- Migrate user profiles from AsyncStorage

**Why first?** Authentication is the foundation. Everything depends on having a logged-in user.

### Phase 2: Logging (Week 2)

**Priority: HIGH** 🔥

- Create logging service
- Update AI Stylist screen to log recommendations
- Update Outfit Scorer screen to log analyses
- Upload images to Storage

**Why second?** Start collecting data immediately. The sooner we start logging, the more valuable history users will have.

### Phase 3: History UI (Week 3)

**Priority: MEDIUM** 🟡

- Create History tab
- List view of analyses
- Detail modal on click
- Delete functionality
- Pull to refresh

**Why third?** Once data is being logged, give users a way to view it. This is when the value becomes visible to users.

### Phase 4: Enhancements (Week 4+)

**Priority: LOW** 🔵

- Bookmarks
- Search and filters
- Analytics dashboard
- Export to PDF
- Social sharing

**Why last?** Nice-to-have features. The app is fully functional without these, but they add polish.

## 🚨 Potential Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Migration from AsyncStorage

**Problem**: Existing users have data in AsyncStorage
**Solution**:

- On first login after update, migrate data to Supabase
- Keep AsyncStorage as backup for offline mode
- Show migration progress UI

### Challenge 2: Image Upload Size

**Problem**: Large images can be slow to upload
**Solution**:

- Compress images before upload (use expo-image-manipulator)
- Show upload progress
- Set max size limit (5MB)
- Use thumbnail for list view, full image for detail view

### Challenge 3: Offline Mode

**Problem**: Users might not always have internet
**Solution**:

- Cache recent analyses in AsyncStorage
- Queue actions when offline
- Sync when online
- Show "offline mode" indicator

### Challenge 4: Cost at Scale

**Problem**: Free tier limits
**Solution**:

- Free tier: 500MB DB, 1GB storage, 50k users
- At scale, upgrade to Pro ($25/month for 8GB DB, 100GB storage)
- Optimize: Delete old images, compress data
- Charge users for premium features if needed

## 💬 Questions to Consider

Before we start, think about:

1. **Authentication**: Email/Password only, or also Google/Apple sign-in?
2. **Data retention**: Keep all history forever, or delete after X days?
3. **Privacy**: Allow users to delete their account and all data?
4. **Sharing**: Should users be able to share analyses publicly?
5. **Analytics**: Track usage metrics (anonymously)?

**My defaults** (if you're not sure):

1. Email + Google + Apple
2. Keep forever (storage is cheap)
3. Yes (GDPR compliance)
4. Yes, but opt-in
5. Yes, anonymized
