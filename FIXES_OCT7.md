# üîß Bug Fixes - October 7, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Speech Recognition Error on Mobile

**Error:** `TypeError: Cannot read property 'startSpeech' of null`

**Root Cause:**

- Web Speech API (`@react-native-voice/voice`) was being called on mobile but not properly initialized
- The Voice module returns `null` on React Native, causing the crash
- Web Speech API is unreliable on mobile platforms

**Solution:**

- Disabled Web Speech API on mobile platforms (Android/iOS)
- Mobile now uses **hold-to-speak only** (press and hold microphone button)
- Web platform can still use click-to-speak
- Added platform checks to prevent calling unavailable APIs

**Files Modified:**

- `app/ai-stylist.tsx`:
  - Added `Platform.OS !== 'web'` check in `startSpeechRecognition()`
  - Updated `handleVoicePress()` to only use hold-to-speak on mobile
  - Added clear logging to indicate mobile uses hold-to-speak

**Code Changes:**

```typescript
// Before: Tried to use Web Speech API on mobile ‚ùå
const startSpeechRecognition = useCallback(async () => {
  await speechService.startListening(...); // Crashes on mobile!
});

// After: Only use on web platform ‚úÖ
const startSpeechRecognition = useCallback(async () => {
  if (Platform.OS !== 'web') {
    console.log('üéôÔ∏è Speech recognition disabled on mobile - use hold-to-speak instead');
    return;
  }
  await speechService.startListening(...); // Only runs on web
});
```

**User Experience:**

- **Mobile (Android/iOS)**: Press and hold microphone button to record
- **Web**: Can click microphone OR press and hold
- No more errors or crashes!

### 2. ‚úÖ Removed Purple Chat Box from UI

**Issue:** Purple chat message box was visible on screen during conversation

**User Request:** "there is a purple box coming on the screen but I don't want it remove it from UI completely"

**Solution:**

- Commented out the entire chat messages display component
- Chat messages are still saved internally for context
- UI now shows only camera feed with audio-only interaction
- Clean, minimal Alexa-like experience

**Files Modified:**

- `app/ai-stylist.tsx`:
  - Wrapped `messagesContainer` component in comments
  - Added instructions to uncomment if needed later

**Code Changes:**

```typescript
// Before: Chat messages visible ‚ùå
{messages.length > 0 && (
  <View style={styles.messagesContainer}>
    <ScrollView>
      {messages.slice(-3).map(...)}
    </ScrollView>
  </View>
)}

// After: Chat messages hidden ‚úÖ
{/* Chat messages hidden - audio-only experience */}
{/* Uncomment below to show chat history on screen */}
{/* ... all chat UI code ... */}
```

**User Experience:**

- No more purple box on screen
- Clean camera view with just controls
- Audio-only conversation (like Alexa)
- Still saves chat history internally for context

## Remaining Issues to Investigate

### Vision API First-Attempt Failure

**Observation:**

```
LOG  üîÑ Vision API attempt 1/2...
ERROR  ‚ùå Vision API request timed out after 20 seconds
LOG  üîÑ Vision API attempt 2/2...
LOG  ‚úÖ Vision API success on attempt 2
```

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Network latency** - First request takes too long
2. **Cold start** - Pollinations AI server needs warm-up
3. **Image processing** - Large image takes time to upload
4. **Timeout too short** - 20s might not be enough for large images

**Next Steps to Debug:**

- [ ] Check image size being uploaded (might be too large)
- [ ] Test with smaller image resolution
- [ ] Increase timeout from 20s to 30s
- [ ] Add image compression before upload
- [ ] Check network speed/stability

**Code to Check:**

```typescript
// In utils/visionAPI.ts - increase timeout?
const timeoutPromise = new Promise(
  (_, reject) => setTimeout(() => reject(new Error("timeout")), 20000) // Try 30000?
);

// Check image size before upload
console.log("üìè Image size:", imageFile.size, "bytes");
```

### Lengthy Single Audio Output

**Issue:** AI response is one long audio instead of chunked sentences

**Expected:** Sentence-by-sentence audio (Phase 1 progressive streaming)
**Actual:** One long audio file

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Not yet implemented (Phase 1 feature)

**Solution (To Be Implemented):**

- Break AI response into sentences
- Generate TTS for each sentence separately
- Play sentences sequentially as they're generated
- User hears response faster (feels more real-time)

**Files to Modify:**

- `utils/streamingResponseHandler.ts` - Add sentence splitting
- `app/ai-stylist.tsx` - Implement progressive audio playback

**Implementation Plan:**

```typescript
// Split response into sentences
const sentences = response.split(/[.!?]+/).filter((s) => s.trim());

// Generate and play each sentence
for (const sentence of sentences) {
  const audio = await generateSpeakBackAudio(sentence);
  await playAudio(audio.uri);
  // Next sentence starts immediately after
}
```

### System Not Listening to Voice Commands Yet

**Issue:** User reports system not responding to voice commands

**Current Status:**

- ‚úÖ Hold-to-speak: **WORKING** (press and hold mic button)
- ‚ùå Hands-free mode: **NOT YET ACTIVE** (Phase 1 VAD feature)
- ‚ùå Wake word: **NOT IMPLEMENTED** (Phase 2 feature)

**Why It's Not Listening:**

1. **Hands-free mode not enabled** - Toggle the "Hands-Free" button to activate VAD
2. **VAD might not be working** - Voice Activity Detection needs testing
3. **User might be clicking instead of holding** - Must press and hold mic button

**How to Use Current System:**

1. Tap "Tap to start chat" button (purple mic) to start conversation
2. **Press and HOLD** the microphone button
3. Speak while holding
4. Release button when done speaking
5. AI will process and respond

**To Enable Hands-Free Mode:**

1. Start a conversation
2. Toggle "Hands-Free" button (appears after starting chat)
3. System will auto-detect when you speak
4. No need to hold button anymore

**Next Steps:**

- [ ] Test VAD hands-free mode
- [ ] Debug if VAD not detecting speech
- [ ] Check microphone sensitivity settings
- [ ] Verify VAD threshold values

## Testing Checklist

### ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

- [x] No more "Cannot read property 'startSpeech' of null" error
- [x] Purple chat box removed from UI
- [x] App doesn't crash on mobile when tapping mic button
- [x] Hold-to-speak works correctly

### ‚è≥ To Test

- [ ] Vision API reliability (why first attempt fails?)
- [ ] Hands-free mode (VAD) functionality
- [ ] Progressive audio streaming (sentence-by-sentence)
- [ ] Image compression for faster uploads
- [ ] Network stability with different connections

## How to Use Current System

### Mobile (Android/iOS) - Recommended Method

1. **Start Conversation**

   - Tap the purple microphone button at bottom
   - Wait for "Live Chat" indicator at top

2. **Record Your Voice**

   - **PRESS AND HOLD** the microphone button
   - Speak your question while holding
   - **RELEASE** when you're done speaking
   - Do NOT just tap - you must hold!

3. **Wait for Response**

   - System captures image
   - Converts speech to text
   - Analyzes outfit
   - AI speaks response

4. **Continue Conversation**

   - Repeat step 2 for next question
   - Context is remembered

5. **End Conversation**
   - Tap "Quit Chat" button at top

### Web Platform (Optional)

1. Can use click-to-speak OR hold-to-speak
2. Click mic to start continuous listening
3. OR press and hold like mobile
