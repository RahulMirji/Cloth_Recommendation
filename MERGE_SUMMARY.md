## 🔧 Merge Conflict Resolution

### Resolved Conflicts
1. **package.json**
   - Kept newer package versions from frontend
   - Added audio/speech packages from vision
   - Merged all dependencies

2. **package-lock.json**
   - Removed and regenerated after merge
   - All dependencies installed successfully

3. **screens/HomeScreen.tsx**
   - Kept frontend's improved dark mode logic
   - Merged both import statements

4. **app/ai-stylist.tsx**
   - Kept vision branch version (1212 lines)
   - Contains complete voice/TTS implementation
   - More feature-complete than frontend version

### Strategy Used
- Frontend had newer Expo SDK versions → kept those
- Vision had audio features → added missing packages
- For code conflicts, kept more feature-complete version
- Regenerated package-lock.json for clean state
