# User Data Fetching from Supabase - Implementation Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented user data fetching from Supabase after login and displaying it in the UI.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Auth Store (`store/authStore.ts`)
- ✅ Added Supabase integration to the Zustand store
- ✅ Added `session` state to track Supabase authentication session
- ✅ Created `loadUserProfileFromSupabase()` function to fetch user data from the `user_profiles` table
- ✅ Modified `initializeAuth()` to:
  - Check for existing Supabase session on app start
  - Fetch user profile from Supabase if session exists
  - Set up auth state listener to automatically fetch profile on login
  - Handle logout by clearing both Supabase session and local data
- ✅ Enhanced `updateUserProfile()` to sync changes to Supabase
- ✅ Enhanced `logout()` to sign out from Supabase

### 2. User Profile Display Components

#### Created `UserProfileCard.tsx`
A new reusable component that displays user information in a beautiful card format:
- Shows user avatar (image or placeholder)
- Displays name, email, phone, and age
- Dark mode support
- Glassmorphism design
- Clickable to navigate to profile screen

### 3. Updated HomeScreen (`screens/HomeScreen.tsx`)
- ✅ Added `UserProfileCard` component to display user info
- ✅ Card shows below the greeting and above the feature cards
- ✅ Only displays if user has a name (authenticated)
- ✅ Tappable to navigate to full profile screen

### 4. Enhanced Sign-Up Flow (`screens/auth/SignUpScreen.tsx`)
- ✅ Creates user profile in Supabase `user_profiles` table immediately after registration
- ✅ Stores user's name and email in the database
- ✅ Profile data is ready for immediate use after first sign-in

### 5. App Layout Integration (`app/_layout.tsx`)
- ✅ Initializes auth store on app mount
- ✅ Ensures Supabase session is checked and user data is loaded on app start

## How It Works

### Sign-Up Flow
1. User signs up with name, email, and password
2. Supabase creates authentication account
3. App creates entry in `user_profiles` table with user data
4. User can now sign in

### Sign-In Flow
1. User signs in with email and password
2. Supabase authenticates and creates session
3. Auth store's `onAuthStateChange` listener detects the new session
4. `loadUserProfileFromSupabase()` is automatically called
5. User profile data is fetched from `user_profiles` table
6. Profile data is stored in:
   - Zustand store (in-memory state)
   - AsyncStorage (persistent cache)
7. UI automatically updates with user data

### Data Display
- **HomeScreen**: Shows `UserProfileCard` with avatar, name, email, phone, age
- **ProfileScreen**: Shows full profile details with edit capability
- **Settings**: Can access profile from settings
- All screens use `useUserProfile()` hook to access current user data

## Database Schema Used

```sql
user_profiles table:
- id (uuid, primary key)
- user_id (uuid, references auth.users)
- name (text)
- email (text)
- phone (text, optional)
- age (integer, optional)
- gender (text, optional)
- bio (text, optional)
- profile_image (text, optional - URL)
- created_at (timestamp)
- updated_at (timestamp)
```

## Key Features

### Real-Time Sync
- ✅ User data fetched from Supabase on every login
- ✅ Profile updates saved to both Supabase and local storage
- ✅ Automatic session management

### Caching Strategy
- ✅ Data cached in AsyncStorage for offline access
- ✅ Cache updated whenever data fetched from Supabase
- ✅ Cache cleared on logout

### Error Handling
- ✅ Graceful error handling for network issues
- ✅ Console logging for debugging
- ✅ Falls back to cached data if Supabase unavailable

### User Experience
- ✅ Beautiful profile card on home screen
- ✅ Seamless navigation to full profile
- ✅ Dark mode support
- ✅ Loading states handled
- ✅ Real user data displayed (not mock data)

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. **Sign Up**: Create a new account with name and email
2. **Sign In**: Log in with the new account
3. **Verify**: Check that user name appears on home screen
4. **Profile Card**: Tap the profile card to view full profile
5. **Edit Profile**: Update profile information
6. **Verify Sync**: Log out and log in again - changes should persist
7. **Console**: Check logs for "User profile loaded from Supabase"

## Code Quality

- ✅ TypeScript types for all Supabase queries
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Clean, documented code
- ✅ Follows existing app architecture
- ✅ Reusable components
- ✅ Consistent styling

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. Add profile photo upload to Supabase Storage
2. Implement real-time updates using Supabase Realtime
3. Add profile completion percentage
4. Show profile stats (outfit analyses, scores, etc.)
5. Add social features (share profile, connect with friends)

## Files Modified

1. `store/authStore.ts` - Enhanced with Supabase integration
2. `screens/HomeScreen.tsx` - Added UserProfileCard display
3. `screens/auth/SignUpScreen.tsx` - Create profile on registration
4. `app/_layout.tsx` - Initialize auth store
5. `components/UserProfileCard.tsx` - New component (created)

**Status**: ✅ Complete and Functional

The app now successfully fetches user data from Supabase after login and displays it throughout the UI!
