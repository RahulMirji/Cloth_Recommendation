# üéâ Chat History Feature - Ready for Testing!

## What Was Done

I've successfully completed all 4 integration steps from the quick start guide:

### ‚úÖ Step 1: History Tab in Navigation

- Already existed in `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`
- Uses Clock icon, positioned between Home and Settings

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Outfit Scorer Integration

**File:** `app/outfit-scorer.tsx`

**Added:**

- History loading from previous analyses
- Auto-save after AI analysis completes
- Respects "Save History" toggle

**How it works:**

1. User takes photo and analyzes outfit
2. AI provides score, category, feedback, strengths, improvements
3. Results automatically saved to history (if toggle is ON)
4. User can reopen from History screen to see previous analysis

### ‚úÖ Step 3: AI Stylist Integration

**File:** `app/ai-stylist.tsx`

**Added:**

- History loading from previous conversations
- Auto-save 2 seconds after last message (debounced)
- Manual save when user exits screen
- Respects "Save History" toggle

**How it works:**

1. User starts conversation with AI Stylist
2. Each message exchange is tracked
3. Conversation auto-saves after 2 second pause
4. Also saves when user presses back button
5. User can reopen from History screen to continue conversation
