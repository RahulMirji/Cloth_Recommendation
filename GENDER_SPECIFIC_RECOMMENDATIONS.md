## 🎯 Key Changes

### 1. Fashion Bags - Now Gender-Specific ✅

**Before:**

- "bag" was in **unisex** category
- Fashion handbags/purses recommended to **both men and women** ❌

**After:**

- "bag" **removed from unisex** category
- **Men** get: Briefcase, Laptop Bag, Messenger Bag, Duffle Bag 💼
- **Women** get: Handbag, Tote, Clutch, Crossbody, Hobo Bag 👜

---

## 📋 Changes Made

### A. Gender Detection (`utils/genderDetection.ts`)

#### Removed "bag" from Unisex Category

**Before:**

```typescript
unisex: {
  all: [
    'jacket',
    'coat',
    'sneakers',
    'casual shoes',
    'sunglasses',
    'watch',
    'backpack',
    'bag',  // ❌ This allowed handbags for men
    'cap',
    'hat',
    // ...
  ],
}
```

**After:**

```typescript
unisex: {
  all: [
    'jacket',
    'coat',
    'sneakers',
    'casual shoes',
    'sunglasses',
    'watch',
    'backpack',
    // 'bag' removed - now gender-specific ✅
    'cap',
    'hat',
    // ...
  ],
}
```

**Impact:**

- Fashion bags are now **filtered by gender**
- Men won't see handbag/purse recommendations
- Women won't see briefcase recommendations (unless professional context)

---

### B. Product Templates (`utils/productRecommendations.ts`)

#### Updated All Product Images to Gender-Specific

Changed all product image URLs from:

```
?w=400
```

To:

```
?w=400&h=400&fit=crop
```

This ensures:

- **Square thumbnails** (400x400)
- **Proper cropping** for consistent display
- **Better image quality** across all devices

## 🔍 How Gender Filtering Works

### Detection Process

1. **AI Analysis**

   - Detects gender from outfit analysis text
   - Uses keywords, clothing types, context clues
   - Returns: `male`, `female`, `unisex`, or `unknown`

2. **Occasion Analysis**

   - Detects: `professional`, `casual`, `party`, `ethnic`, etc.
   - Context: "interview", "office", "wedding", "date"

3. **Item Filtering**

   ```typescript
   filterItemCategoriesByGender(itemType, gender, occasion);
   ```

   - Checks if item is appropriate for detected gender
   - Returns `true` if appropriate, `false` if not

4. **Template Selection**
   ```typescript
   if (gender === "male" && itemTemplate.male) {
     templates = itemTemplate.male[style] || [];
   } else if (gender === "female" && itemTemplate.female) {
     templates = itemTemplate.female[style] || [];
   }
   ```
