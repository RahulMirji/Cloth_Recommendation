## 🎯 Example: Real-World Scenario

### User Uploads: White shirt + Black pants for **Job Interview**

### **Before**:

```
Analysis: "Nice outfit, good colors"
Missing Items: tie, shoes (2 items)
Score: 65/100
Recommendations: 2 categories
```

### **After**:

```
Analysis:
"White cotton shirt well-ironed but slightly loose at shoulders.

## 🎨 Key Features Explained

### 1. Visual Scanning Checklist

AI systematically examines:

```
HEAD → FACE → NECK → UPPER BODY → TORSO → ARMS →
HANDS → LOWER BODY → FEET → OVERALL ACCESSORIES
```

### 2. Micro-Detail Extraction

For each component:

- **Fabric**: Material type, texture, quality
- **Pattern**: Stripes, checks, solid, scale
- **Color**: Shades, undertones, saturation
- **Fit**: Length, tightness, alignment
- **Condition**: Wrinkles, stains, wear
- **Styling**: Tucked, rolled, buttons

### 3. Context-Aware Priority Boosting

```typescript
Interview/Formal → Boost: tie, blazer, dress shoes, belt, watch
Wedding/Party → Boost: jewelry, watch, formal accessories
Casual/Weekend → Boost: sneakers, t-shirt, casual jacket
Ethnic/Festival → Boost: kurta, traditional jewelry
```

### 4. Score-Based Matching

```typescript
Match Score =
  Positive Keyword (+10) +
  Synonym Match (+15) +
  Cleaned Text (+8) +
  Context Boost (+5)

Threshold: 8+ points to qualify
Negative Keywords: Disqualifies (0 points)
```

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Issue**: AI returns non-JSON response  
**Solution**: The prompt now emphasizes "respond ONLY with valid JSON"

**Issue**: Too few items detected  
**Solution**: Check console logs, verify improvements array has specific mentions

**Issue**: False positives  
**Solution**: Add negative keywords to item config, increase threshold

**Issue**: Context not working  
**Solution**: Verify context string matches contextBoost keywords

### Debug Checklist:

- [ ] Check console for "Analyzing outfit with AI..."
- [ ] Verify AI response is valid JSON
- [ ] Check "🔍 Missing Items Extraction" log
- [ ] Verify match scores in logs
- [ ] Confirm context is passed correctly
- [ ] Check recommendations are generated
