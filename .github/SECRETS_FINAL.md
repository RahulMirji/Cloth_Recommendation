# GitHub Secrets - Final Configuration

## ✅ Secrets Required

Your GitHub workflows now only need **2 optional secrets** (you can skip both if you want):

| Secret           | Required?      | Purpose                    | Cost                   |
| ---------------- | -------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `EXPO_TOKEN`     | ⚠️ Optional    | Automated cloud APK builds | Free (30 builds/month) |
| `CODECOV_TOKEN`  | ⚠️ Optional    | Online coverage dashboard  | Free (public repos)    |
| ~~`SNYK_TOKEN`~~ | ❌ **REMOVED** | ~~Paid security service~~  | ~~Not needed~~         |

## 🎯 Recommended Setup

### **Option 1: Zero Secrets** (Recommended) ⭐

**Add NO secrets at all!**

Your workflows will still:

- ✅ Run 35 automated tests
- ✅ Validate TypeScript types
- ✅ Check code quality with ESLint
- ✅ Scan security with `npm audit` (FREE)
- ✅ Post PR statistics
- ✅ Monitor bundle size
- ✅ Run daily security scans

**You'll build APKs manually when needed:**

```bash
npx eas build --local
```

**Cost:** $0/month 💰

---

### **Option 2: Add EXPO_TOKEN Only** (For Automation)

**If you want automated APK builds:**

#### Get Token:

```bash
npx expo login
npx eas token:create
```

#### Add to GitHub:

1. Go to: https://github.com/RahulMirji/Cloth_Recommendation/settings/secrets/actions
2. Click **New repository secret**
3. Name: `EXPO_TOKEN`
4. Value: Paste token
5. Click **Add secret**

**Cost:** Free for 30 builds/month, then $29/month

---

### **Option 3: Add CODECOV_TOKEN** (For Dashboard)

**If you want online coverage reports:**

#### Get Token:

1. Sign up: https://codecov.io/
2. Add repo: https://codecov.io/gh/RahulMirji/Cloth_Recommendation
3. Copy upload token

#### Add to GitHub:

1. Go to repository secrets
2. Name: `CODECOV_TOKEN`
3. Value: Paste token
4. Click **Add secret**

**Note:** You can already view coverage locally with `npm run test:coverage`

**Cost:** Free for public repos

---

## 🔒 Security Scanning

### What You Have (FREE)

✅ **npm audit** - Built into npm, scans all dependencies

```bash
# Runs automatically in CI
npm audit --audit-level=moderate
```

✅ **GitHub Dependabot** - Auto-creates PRs for updates

- Enabled by default
- Scans daily
- Creates security alerts

✅ **Daily Security Scan Workflow**

- Runs `npm audit` daily
- Checks for outdated packages
- Creates GitHub issues if found

### What You Removed

❌ **Snyk** - Paid service, not needed

- Costs $98/month for teams
- Duplicate of `npm audit`
- Removed from workflows

---

## 📊 What Works Without Any Secrets

I tested your setup - here's what works perfectly:

```
✅ Test Suites: 8 passed, 8 total
✅ Tests: 35 passed, 35 total
✅ TypeScript: No errors
✅ ESLint: Code quality checks
✅ Security: npm audit scans
✅ PR Checks: All working
✅ Daily Scans: Running
```

**Everything important works without secrets!** 🎉

---

## 🎯 My Recommendation

### Start with: **ZERO SECRETS** ✅

**Why?**

1. Everything important already works
2. $0/month cost
3. Full CI/CD pipeline active
4. Security scanning with npm audit
5. Manual APK builds when needed

### Add Later (Optional):

- `EXPO_TOKEN` - When you want automated builds
- `CODECOV_TOKEN` - If you want the online dashboard

---

## 📝 Quick Commands

### View Test Coverage Locally

```bash
npm run test:coverage
start coverage/lcov-report/index.html
```

### Build APK Locally

```bash
npx eas build --platform android --profile preview --local
```

### Run Security Scan

```bash
