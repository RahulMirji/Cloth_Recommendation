## Detailed Analysis

### 1. **`pollinationsAI.ts`** ✅

**Functions Exported:**
- `generateText()` - Internal function used by `generateTextWithImage()`
- `generateTextWithImage()` - Main AI vision function
- `convertImageToBase64()` - Image conversion utility

**Usage:**
- **AI Stylist:** Uses `generateTextWithImage()`, `convertImageToBase64()`
- **OutfitScorer:** Uses `generateTextWithImage()`, `convertImageToBase64()`

**Conclusion:** ✅ Both versions are identical and needed. No extra code in OutfitScorer.

---

### 2. **`Footer.tsx`** ✅

**Usage:**
- **HomeScreen:** Imports from `@/components/Footer`
- **ProfileScreen:** Imports from `@/components/Footer`

- **ProfileScreen:** Uses `uploadProfileImage()` from `@/hooks/useImageUpload`
- **OutfitScorerScreen:** Uses `uploadOutfitImage()` from `@/OutfitScorer/hooks/useImageUpload`

**Differences:**
- **Root version:** Imports from `@/utils/supabaseStorage`
- **OutfitScorer version:** Imports from `@/OutfitScorer/utils/supabaseStorage`

**Conclusion:** ✅ Both versions needed. The only difference is import paths (intentional). No extra code.

## Import Path Verification

### AI Stylist Imports (From Root):
```typescript
// app/ai-stylist.tsx line 21
import { generateTextWithImage, convertImageToBase64 } from '@/utils/pollinationsAI';
```

### OutfitScorer Imports (From Module):
```typescript
// OutfitScorer/screens/OutfitScorerScreen.tsx
import { convertImageToBase64, generateTextWithImage } from '@/OutfitScorer/utils/pollinationsAI';
import { saveChatHistory, getChatHistoryById } from '@/OutfitScorer/utils/chatHistory';
```

### ProfileScreen Imports (From Root):
```typescript
// screens/ProfileScreen.tsx
import { Footer } from '@/components/Footer';
import { useImageUpload } from '@/hooks/useImageUpload';
```

**Conclusion:** ✅ All imports are correctly separated. No cross-contamination.

## Code Duplication Analysis

### Why Duplication Is Intentional:

1. **True Modularity** - OutfitScorer can be moved/deleted without affecting other features
2. **Independent Development** - Changes to OutfitScorer don't impact AI Stylist
3. **No Shared State** - Each feature maintains its own version
4. **Future-Proof** - Easy to modularize AI Stylist using same pattern

### Files That Are Duplicated (And Why):

| File | Reason for Duplication |
|------|----------------------|
| `pollinationsAI.ts` | Used by both AI Stylist and OutfitScorer - both need 60s timeout |
| `Footer.tsx` | Used by HomeScreen, ProfileScreen, and OutfitScorer |
| `useImageUpload.ts` | Used by ProfileScreen (profile photos) and OutfitScorer (outfit images) |
| `chatHistory.ts` | Used by OutfitHistoryList (delete) and OutfitScorer (save/load) |
| `supabaseStorage.ts` | Used by both root and OutfitScorer via useImageUpload |
