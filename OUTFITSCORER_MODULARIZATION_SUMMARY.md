## 🔄 Import Path Updates

### ✅ Updated Files

| File | Old Import | New Import |

| **chatHistory.ts** | `../types/chatHistory.types` | `@/OutfitScorer/types/chatHistory.types` |

### ✅ Preserved Global Imports

|--------|--------|
| `@/constants/colors` | Shared color palette |
| `@/constants/themedColors` | Shared theme system |
| `@/constants/fonts` | Shared typography |
| `@/contexts/AppContext` | Global app state |
| `@/lib/supabase` | Shared database client |

## 🔗 Route Compatibility

### Main Route Wrapper
**File:** `app/outfit-scorer.tsx`

```typescript
// Outfit Scorer Route Wrapper
export { default } from '@/OutfitScorer/screens/OutfitScorerScreen';
```

This maintains **100% backward compatibility** with existing navigation:
- ✅ `router.push('/outfit-scorer')` still works
- ✅ History entries with `historyId` parameter still work
- ✅ No changes needed in `_layout.tsx`
- ✅ No changes needed in `HomeScreen.tsx`
- ✅ No changes needed in `OutfitHistoryList.tsx`

---

## 📦 Module Exports (index.ts files)

### Main Module (`/OutfitScorer/index.ts`)
```typescript
export { default as OutfitScorerScreen } from './screens/OutfitScorerScreen';
export * from './components';
export * from './utils';
export * from './hooks';
export * from './types';
```

### Components (`/OutfitScorer/components/index.ts`)
```typescript
export { ProductRecommendationsSection } from './ProductRecommendations';

```typescript
export * from './pollinationsAI';
export * from './productRecommendations';
export * from './productRecommendationStorage';
export * from './chatHistory';
export * from './supabaseStorage';
export * from './genderDetection';
```

### Hooks (`/OutfitScorer/hooks/index.ts`)
```typescript
export { useImageUpload } from './useImageUpload';
```

## 🎓 Developer Notes

### For New Developers
- All Outfit Scorer code is in `/OutfitScorer`
- Check `/OutfitScorer/index.ts` for available exports
- Use existing route `/outfit-scorer` for navigation
- Global resources (colors, themes, contexts) imported from root

### For Maintenance
- Feature-specific changes only affect `/OutfitScorer`
- Global changes (colors, themes) update automatically
- Database schema changes require type updates in `/OutfitScorer/types`

### For Extension
- Add new components in `/OutfitScorer/components`
- Add new utilities in `/OutfitScorer/utils`
- Export from respective index.ts files
- Update main `/OutfitScorer/index.ts` if needed
