# 🔧 502 Error & Network Issues Fix - October 7, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ 502 Bad Gateway Errors - Graceful Fallback

**Error:** `API request failed: 502 - 502 Bad Gateway. Unable to reach the origin service`

**Root Cause:**

- Pollinations AI service was temporarily down/unreachable
- Cloudflare proxy couldn't reach the origin server
- No fallback mechanism - app crashed with technical error

**Solution:**

- Added 502 error detection in `utils/pollinationsAI.ts`
- Implemented graceful fallback message instead of crash
- Added 10-second timeout to detect service issues quickly
- User gets friendly message instead of technical error

**Code Changes:**

```typescript
// Before: Crashed with 502 error ❌
throw error;

// After: Graceful fallback ✅
if (errorMessage.includes("502") || errorMessage.includes("Bad Gateway")) {
  return (
    "I'm having trouble connecting to my AI service right now. " +
    "The outfit looks great! Try asking me again in a moment " +
    "when the connection is better."
  );
}
```

**User Experience:**

- **Before:** Red error screen, app crash 😤
- **After:** Friendly message, app continues working ✅

---

### 2. ✅ Vision API 502 Errors - Smart Retry with Fallback

**Error:** Vision API failed with 502 after multiple retries

**Root Cause:**

- Vision API depends on Pollinations AI backend
- When backend is down, all retries fail with 502
- No fallback for service outages

**Solution:**

- Added 502 detection in `utils/visionAPI.ts`
- Smart retry with longer delays for 502 errors (5s vs 2s)
- Graceful fallback after max retries
- User gets helpful message instead of crash

**Code Changes:**

```typescript
// Detect 502 errors
const is502Error =
  lastError.message.includes("502") ||
  lastError.message.includes("Bad Gateway");

// Return fallback instead of throwing error
if (is502Error) {
  return (
    "I'm having trouble connecting to my AI service right now. " +
    "Your outfit looks great! Try asking me again in a moment."
  );
}
```

**Retry Strategy:**

- Normal errors: 2s, 4s, 8s exponential backoff
- 502 errors: 5s, 5s, 5s (longer delays for service recovery)

**User Experience:**

- **Before:** Error after 3 failed attempts 😤
- **After:** Friendly fallback message, app keeps working ✅

---

### 3. ✅ Recording Unload Error - Silent Error Handling

**Error:** `Cannot unload a Recording that has already been unloaded`

**Root Cause:**

- Recording was being unloaded multiple times:
  1. In `stopHoldToSpeak()` function
  2. In component unmount cleanup
- Second unload attempt threw error

**Solution:**

- Added error detection for "already unloaded" errors
- Silently ignore these harmless errors
- Set `isRecordingUnloaded` flag to prevent double-unload
- Proper error handling in both locations

**Code Changes:**

```typescript
// In stopHoldToSpeak()
try {
  await recording.stopAndUnloadAsync();
  setIsRecordingUnloaded(true);
} catch (err: any) {
  // Ignore "already unloaded" errors
  if (!err.message?.includes("already been unloaded")) {
    console.error("Error:", err);
    throw err;
  }
}

// In cleanup
recording.stopAndUnloadAsync().catch((err) => {
  // Silently ignore "already unloaded" errors
  if (!err.message?.includes("already been unloaded")) {
    console.log("Error unloading recording:", err);
  }
});
```

**User Experience:**

- **Before:** Console error on every quit
- **After:** Clean, error-free operation ✅

## Technical Details

### 502 Error Detection Strategy

**What triggers fallback:**

1. `error.message.includes('502')`
2. `error.message.includes('Bad Gateway')`
3. `error.message.includes('cloudflared')`
4. `error.name === 'AbortError'` (timeout)

**Fallback Messages:**

- **Text API:** "I'm having trouble connecting to my AI service right now. The outfit looks great! Try asking me again in a moment when the connection is better."
- **Vision API:** "I'm having trouble connecting to my AI service right now. Your outfit looks great! Try asking me again in a moment when the connection is better."

### Network Timeout Strategy

**Pollinations AI API:**

- Timeout: 10 seconds (fast fail)
- Retry: Automatic with exponential backoff
- Fallback: Friendly message

**Vision API:**

- Attempt 1: 10s timeout
- Attempt 2: 15s timeout
- Attempt 3: 20s timeout
- Retry delay: 2-8s (normal), 5s (502 errors)

### Files Modified

1. **`utils/pollinationsAI.ts`**

   - Added 10s timeout with AbortController
   - Added 502 error detection
   - Implemented graceful fallback message
   - Lines changed: ~15 lines

2. **`utils/visionAPI.ts`**

   - Added 502 error detection in retry loop
   - Implemented smart retry delays for 502
   - Added fallback message for service outages
   - Lines changed: ~25 lines

3. **`app/ai-stylist.tsx`**
   - Added "already unloaded" error detection
   - Set `isRecordingUnloaded` flag properly
   - Silent error handling for cleanup
   - Lines changed: ~10 lines

## Error Handling Flow

### Before Fix

```
API Request → 502 Error → Throw Error → App Crash → Red Error Screen
                                                           ↓
                                                    User frustrated 😤
```

### After Fix

```
API Request → 502 Error → Detect 502 → Return Fallback Message → TTS Speaks
                                                                        ↓
                                                              User gets response ✅
```

## User Experience Comparison

### Scenario: Pollinations AI is Down

**Before Fix:**

```
User: [Holds mic] "How does this outfit look?"
App: [Processes]
App: ❌ ERROR: API request failed: 502 - 502 Bad Gateway...
     [Red error screen with technical details]
User: "What? It crashed again!" 😤
```

**After Fix:**

```
User: [Holds mic] "How does this outfit look?"
App: [Processes]

## Network Resilience

### API Availability Handling

| API Status        | App Behavior         | User Experience          |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Online** ✅     | Normal operation     | Full AI responses        |
| **Slow** 🐌       | Retries with backoff | Slight delay, then works |
| **Down (502)** ❌ | Fallback message     | Friendly offline message |
| **Timeout** ⏱️    | Fast fail (10s)      | Quick fallback           |

### Retry Strategy

**Normal Errors (network glitch):**

- Retry 1: Immediate
- Retry 2: +2s delay
- Retry 3: +4s delay
- Max wait: 6s total

**502 Errors (service down):**

- Retry 1: Immediate
- Retry 2: +5s delay
- Retry 3: +5s delay
- Max wait: 10s total
- Then: Return fallback

## Monitoring & Debugging

### How to Test Service Outage

1. **Simulate 502 Error:**

   - Wait for Pollinations AI to be down (happens occasionally)
   - OR modify code to force 502 response

2. **Expected Behavior:**

   - First request: Try normally (10s timeout)
   - If 502: Retry with 5s delay
   - If 502 again: Retry with 5s delay
   - If 502 third time: Return fallback message
   - User hears: "I'm having trouble connecting..."

3. **Check Logs:**
   ```
   LOG  🔄 Vision API attempt 1/3...
   ERROR ❌ Vision API attempt 1/3 failed: 502 Bad Gateway
   LOG  ⏳ Waiting 5000ms before retry...
   LOG  🔄 Vision API attempt 2/3...
   ERROR ❌ Vision API attempt 2/3 failed: 502 Bad Gateway
   LOG  ⏳ Waiting 5000ms before retry...
   LOG  🔄 Vision API attempt 3/3...
   ERROR ❌ Vision API attempt 3/3 failed: 502 Bad Gateway
   WARN ⚠️ Vision API service unavailable, returning offline fallback
   ```

### Debug Logging

All errors are logged to console with clear prefixes:

- `🔄` - Retry attempt
- `❌` - Error occurred
- `⏳` - Waiting before retry
- `⚠️` - Fallback triggered
- `✅` - Success

---

## Known Limitations

### When Fallback is Used

1. **Pollinations AI completely down** - Returns generic fallback
2. **Cloudflare proxy issues** - Returns fallback
3. **Network timeout (>10s)** - Returns fallback

### Fallback Quality

- **Generic message** - Not analyzing the actual outfit
- **Encouraging tone** - Keeps user engaged
- **Action item** - "Try again in a moment"

### Future Improvements

- Cache last successful response
- Use local AI fallback (Phase 3)
- Queue requests for retry when service recovers
- Show service status indicator
