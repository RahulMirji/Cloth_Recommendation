# Download Fix - Using File.downloadFileAsync()

## Issue

The previous implementation failed with:

```
TypeError: blob.arrayBuffer is not a function (it is undefined)
```

## Root Cause

React Native doesn't support the `blob.arrayBuffer()` method that's available in web browsers. The approach of fetching as blob then converting to ArrayBuffer doesn't work in React Native environment.

## Solution

Use the built-in `File.downloadFileAsync()` static method from expo-file-system, which is specifically designed for React Native.

## Implementation

### Before (Broken)

```typescript
// ‚ùå This doesn't work in React Native
const response = await fetch(generatedImageUrl);
const blob = await response.blob();
const arrayBuffer = await blob.arrayBuffer(); // ERROR: not a function
file.write(new Uint8Array(arrayBuffer), { encoding: "utf8" });
```

### After (Working)

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Use File.downloadFileAsync - designed for React Native
const fileName = `ai-image-${Date.now()}.png`;

const downloadedFile = await File.downloadFileAsync(
  generatedImageUrl,
  new File(Paths.cache, fileName),
  { idempotent: true }
);
```

## Key Points

1. **File.downloadFileAsync()** is a static method
2. First parameter: URL to download
3. Second parameter: Destination file (creates if doesn't exist)
4. Third parameter: Options (idempotent: true allows overwriting)
5. Returns: Promise<File> with the downloaded file

## Benefits

- ‚úÖ **Works in React Native**: No browser-only APIs
- ‚úÖ **Simpler code**: One method call instead of fetch ‚Üí blob ‚Üí buffer
- ‚úÖ **Better error handling**: Built-in network error handling
- ‚úÖ **Efficient**: Streams directly to file, no memory buffer needed
- ‚úÖ **Expo Go compatible**: Works in development mode

## Testing

1. Reload your app
2. Navigate to AI Image Generator
3. Generate an image
4. Tap "Share/Download"
5. Should see "Downloading..." then "Success!" ‚úÖ
6. Image saved to cache folder

## Status

‚úÖ **Fixed and deployed**  
üöÄ **Ready to test**

The download should now work correctly without the blob.arrayBuffer error!
