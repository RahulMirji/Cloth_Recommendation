## 🔧 What You Configured

You successfully added these secrets to Supabase Dashboard:

```
GMAIL_USER = your-email@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD = **************** (16-char app password)
GMAIL_FROM_NAME = AI Dresser
```

---

## 🎯 Problem Solved

### Before:
```
❌ Resend API Error: {"statusCode":403,"message":"You can only send testing 
   emails to your own email address (devprahulmirji@gmail.com). To send 
   emails to other recipients, please verify a domain at resend.com/domains"}
```

### After:
```
✅ Gmail SMTP: Send OTP to ANY email address
✅ No domain verification required
✅ Completely free (500 emails/day)
✅ Better deliverability
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Next Steps

### Test 1: Verify Email Delivery

**From your mobile app:**
1. Open AI Dresser app
2. Click **Sign Up**
3. Use **ANY email address** (not just yours)
4. Fill in: Name, Email, Password
5. Click **Send OTP**
6. Check the email inbox → OTP should arrive

**Expected result:**
- ✅ API returns success: `{ "success": true, "emailSent": true }`
- ✅ Email arrives within 5-10 seconds
- ✅ Email has beautiful HTML template with 6-digit OTP code

### Test 2: Check Logs (Important!)

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/wmhiwieooqfwkrdcvqvb/functions/send-otp/logs

2. After sending an OTP, you should see:
   ```
   📧 Connecting to Gmail SMTP for: test@example.com
   ✅ Connected to Gmail SMTP
   ✅ Email sent successfully via Gmail SMTP
   ==================================================
   OTP FOR: test@example.com
   OTP CODE: 123456
   EXPIRES AT: 2025-10-10T09:20:00.000Z
   ==================================================
   ```

### Test 3: Complete Sign-Up Flow

1. Send OTP to a test email
2. Copy the 6-digit code from email
3. Enter in app
4. Click **Verify & Sign Up**
5. User should be created in Supabase Auth

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting (If Email Doesn't Send)

### Check 1: Verify Secrets
```bash
# In Supabase Dashboard → Settings → Edge Functions → Secrets
GMAIL_USER = correct email?
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD = exactly 16 characters? no spaces?
```

### Check 2: Edge Function Logs
Look for these error messages:
- **❌ Gmail credentials not configured** → Secrets missing
- **❌ Authentication failed** → Wrong App Password
- **❌ Connection timeout** → Network/firewall issue

### Check 3: Re-generate App Password
1. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
2. Delete old "AI Dresser OTP" password
3. Create new one
4. Copy the 16-character code (remove spaces!)
5. Update in Supabase secrets

### Check 4: Gmail Account Settings
- ✅ 2-Factor Authentication enabled?
- ✅ "Less secure app access" NOT required (we use App Password)
- ✅ No Gmail sending limits hit today?

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Monitor Daily Usage**: Gmail allows 500 emails/day. Add logging to track usage.

2. **Set Up Alerts**: Create a Supabase webhook to notify you if emails fail.

3. **Backup Plan**: If Gmail limit is hit, add fallback to another SMTP provider.

4. **Email Testing Tools**: Use https://mailtrap.io for testing without sending real emails.

5. **Production Hardening**:
   - Add retry logic (3 attempts with exponential backoff)
   - Implement email queue for high traffic
   - Add metrics (sent/failed/queued)

---

## 🎉 Success!

Your AI Dresser app can now send OTP emails to **ANY user** for free! 

**Next time someone signs up:**
1. They enter their email
2. OTP is generated and stored (hashed)
3. Gmail SMTP sends beautiful email
4. User receives code within seconds
5. They verify and complete sign-up

**No more "you can only send to your own email" error!** 🚀
