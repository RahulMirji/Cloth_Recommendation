## 🚀 How to Use

### Running Tests Locally

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

### Viewing CI/CD

1. Go to repository on GitHub
2. Click "Actions" tab
3. View workflow runs
4. Check logs for details

### Adding Secrets (Required for full CI/CD)

1. Go to: `Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions`
2. Add:
   - `EXPO_TOKEN` (optional - for EAS builds)
   - `VERCEL_TOKEN` (optional - for deployments)
   - `VERCEL_ORG_ID` (optional)
   - `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` (optional)
   - `SNYK_TOKEN` (optional - for security scanning)

## 📈 Next Steps
