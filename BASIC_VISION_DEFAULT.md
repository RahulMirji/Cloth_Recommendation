>
  {useEnhancedVision ? (
    <Eye size={16} color={Colors.white} />
  ) : (
    <EyeOff size={16} color={Colors.white} />
  )}
  <Text style={styles.visionToggleText}>
    {useEnhancedVision ? "Enhanced Vision" : "Basic Vision"}
  </Text>
</TouchableOpacity>
```

## Technical Details

### File Modified

- **File**: `app/ai-stylist.tsx`
- **Line**: 46
- **Change**: `useState<boolean>(true)` → `useState<boolean>(false)`

### Impact on Functionality

#### Basic Vision Flow

```
User speaks → Audio recorded → Parallel processing:
├─ Audio → Text (STT)
└─ Camera → Base64 → AI Analysis
```

#### Enhanced Vision Flow (When toggled)

```
User speaks → Audio recorded → Parallel processing:
├─ Audio → Text (STT)
└─ Camera → Upload → URL → AI Analysis
```

### State Management

```typescript
// Default: Basic Vision
const [useEnhancedVision, setUseEnhancedVision] = useState<boolean>(false);

// User toggles
<TouchableOpacity onPress={() => setUseEnhancedVision(!useEnhancedVision)}>
  // UI updates automatically
</TouchableOpacity>;

// Conditional logic
if (useEnhancedVision) {
  // Upload to Supabase
  const imageUrl = await uploadImageAndGetURL();
} else {
  // Process locally
  const imgBase64 = await captureCurrentImage();
}
```
