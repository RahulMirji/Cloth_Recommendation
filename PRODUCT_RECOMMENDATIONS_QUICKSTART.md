## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **No Recommendations Showing?**
✅ **This is normal!** Recommendations only appear when:
- AI detects missing items in the outfit
- "Room for Improvement" mentions specific items
- Try uploading a photo with obviously missing items (e.g., no shoes)

### **Products Not Loading?**
1. Check internet connection
2. Wait a few seconds (recommendations load after main analysis)
3. Look for loading indicator: "Finding perfect products for you..."

### **Marketplace Not Opening?**
1. Make sure you have a browser installed
2. Check app permissions for opening URLs
3. Try tapping a different product
