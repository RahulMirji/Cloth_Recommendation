## Test 5: Parallel Processing (Invisible but Important) 🚀

**What Changed:** STT and image capture happen simultaneously.

**How to Check Logs:**

1. Start conversation
2. Speak a question
3. Check console logs
4. **Expected:** See both:
   ```
   ⚡ STT: Starting audio-to-text conversion...
   ⚡ IMAGE: Starting capture...
   ```
   at nearly the same time ✅

**How to Test (Mobile Only):**

1. Make sure you're on iOS/Android (not web)
2. Ask a question
3. **Expected:** Voice starts immediately after AI thinking (no TTS delay) ✅

**Before:** 3-5 second TTS generation delay  
**After:** Instant playback! 🎉

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Audio still playing after quit

- **Check:** Did you update the code?
- **Solution:** Make sure `stopAllAudio()` is called in `quitConversation()`

### Issue: Responses still too long

- **Check:** Vision API using new prompt?
- **Solution:** Verify `utils/visionAPI.ts` has max_tokens = 80

### Issue: Slow response time

- **Check:** Parallel processing working?
- **Solution:** Check console logs for "⚡ PARALLEL PROCESSING"
