# Shared Files Split Plan

## Objective
Split shared utility files into **two independent versions**:
1. **Original location** - Minimal code for AI Stylist and other features
2. **OutfitScorer module** - Complete code for OutfitScorer feature

## Benefits
- âœ… **True modularity** - OutfitScorer is 100% self-contained
- âœ… **No breaking changes** - AI Stylist continues working independently
- âœ… **Clean separation** - Each feature has its own version
- âœ… **Easy to modularize next** - Same pattern for AI Stylist later

---

## Files to Split

### 1. `utils/pollinationsAI.ts`

**Used By:**
- AI Stylist: `generateTextWithImage()`, `convertImageToBase64()`
- OutfitScorer: `generateTextWithImage()`, `convertImageToBase64()`

**Action:**
- âœ… Keep in `OutfitScorer/utils/pollinationsAI.ts` (already complete with 60s timeout)
- âœ… Keep in `utils/pollinationsAI.ts` (same complete version for AI Stylist)
- Status: **Both versions are identical, no changes needed**

---

### 2. `components/Footer.tsx`

**Used By:**
- HomeScreen (line 33)
- ProfileScreen (line 39)
- OutfitScorerScreen

**Action:**
- âœ… Keep in `OutfitScorer/components/Footer.tsx` (already moved)
- âœ… Keep in `components/Footer.tsx` (for HomeScreen, ProfileScreen)
- Status: **Both versions needed**

---

### 3. `hooks/useImageUpload.ts`

**Used By:**
- ProfileScreen (line 40) - for profile photo uploads
- OutfitScorerScreen - for outfit image uploads

**Action:**
- âœ… Keep in `OutfitScorer/hooks/useImageUpload.ts` (already moved)
- âœ… Keep in `hooks/useImageUpload.ts` (for ProfileScreen)
- Status: **Both versions needed**

---

### 4. `utils/chatHistory.ts`

**Used By:**
- screens/history/OutfitHistoryList.tsx (line 35) - `deleteChatHistory()`
- OutfitScorerScreen - full chat history management

**Action:**
- âœ… Keep in `OutfitScorer/utils/chatHistory.ts` (already moved - complete)
- âœ… Keep in `utils/chatHistory.ts` (minimal version for OutfitHistoryList)
- Status: **Both versions needed, but original can be trimmed**

---

### 5. `utils/supabaseStorage.ts`

**Used By:**
- hooks/useImageUpload.ts (line 9) - `uploadImageToStorage()`, `replaceImage()`
- OutfitScorer hooks/useImageUpload.ts

**Action:**
- âœ… Keep in `OutfitScorer/utils/supabaseStorage.ts` (already moved)
- âœ… Keep in `utils/supabaseStorage.ts` (for non-OutfitScorer features)
- Status: **Both versions needed**

---

## Files That Are OutfitScorer-Exclusive (Safe to Delete from Root)

### âœ… Can Delete These from Root:
1. âœ… `components/ProductRecommendations.tsx` - Only used by OutfitScorer
2. âœ… `components/OutfitScorerShowcase.tsx` - Only used by OutfitScorer  
3. âœ… `utils/productRecommendations.ts` - Only used by OutfitScorer
4. âœ… `utils/productRecommendationStorage.ts` - Only used by OutfitScorer
5. âœ… `utils/genderDetection.ts` - Only used by productRecommendations.ts
6. âœ… `types/chatHistory.types.ts` - Only used by OutfitScorer module now

---

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Verify Shared Files Are Present in Both Locations âœ…
- [x] `pollinationsAI.ts` exists in both locations
- [x] `Footer.tsx` exists in both locations  
- [x] `useImageUpload.ts` exists in both locations
- [x] `chatHistory.ts` exists in both locations
- [x] `supabaseStorage.ts` exists in both locations

### Step 2: Delete OutfitScorer-Exclusive Files from Root ðŸ”„
Delete these files (they only exist for OutfitScorer):
```bash
# Safe to delete - OutfitScorer-exclusive
rm components/ProductRecommendations.tsx
rm components/OutfitScorerShowcase.tsx
rm utils/productRecommendations.ts
rm utils/productRecommendationStorage.ts
rm utils/genderDetection.ts
rm types/chatHistory.types.ts
```

### Step 3: Test All Features âœ…
- [ ] Test OutfitScorer - should work (uses OutfitScorer/*)
- [ ] Test AI Stylist - should work (uses utils/pollinationsAI)
- [ ] Test ProfileScreen - should work (uses hooks/useImageUpload, components/Footer)
- [ ] Test HomeScreen - should work (uses components/Footer)
- [ ] Test OutfitHistoryList - should work (uses utils/chatHistory)

### Step 4: Final Commit ðŸŽ¯
- Create commit with all changes
- Update documentation
