# üé§ Speech Recognition Solution for Expo Go

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Files restored to working state**  
‚úÖ **App should load without errors now**  
‚ö†Ô∏è **STT uses placeholder text** (not real speech)

---

## The Issue

`expo-speech-recognition` requires a **development build** and doesn't work in **Expo Go**.

---

## Working Solution Options

### Option 1: Keep Current Placeholders (Fastest)

**Status**: ‚úÖ **Working NOW**

- Audio records successfully
- Uses contextual placeholder text
- Vision API works
- TTS works

**When to use**: Quick testing, demos

---

### Option 2: Use OpenAI Whisper API (Best for Expo Go)

**Cost**: ~$0.006/minute (~$0.36/hour)  
**Setup time**: 5 minutes  
**Accuracy**: 95%+

#### Quick Setup:

```bash
# 1. Get API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

# 2. Add to .env file:
echo "EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here" >> .env

# 3. I'll update the code to use Whisper
```

‚úÖ Works in Expo Go  
‚úÖ Very accurate  
‚úÖ Fast (1-2 seconds)  
‚úÖ Supports 99 languages

---

### Option 3: Build Development Client (Best for Production)

**Cost**: Free  
**Setup time**: 15-20 minutes  
**Accuracy**: Native (95%+)

#### Steps:

```bash
# Option A: Local build (requires Android Studio)
npx expo prebuild
npx expo run:android

# Option B: Cloud build (requires EAS account)
npm install -g eas-cli
eas login
eas build --profile development --platform android
```

‚úÖ Free  
‚úÖ Works offline  
‚úÖ On-device processing  
‚úÖ Sub-second latency  
‚ùå Can't use Expo Go anymore

---

## Recommendation

### For Now (Testing in Expo Go):

**Keep using placeholders** - App works fine for testing vision + TTS features

### For Production:

**Create development build** - Best user experience, free, offline capable

### If You Need Real STT in Expo Go:

**Use Whisper API** - Small cost, very accurate

## Next Steps

**Your app is working now!** üéâ

Please reload and test:

```bash
# In Expo terminal, press 'r' to reload
```

Let me know if you want to:

1. **Keep placeholders** for now
2. **Add Whisper API** (I can do this quickly)
3. **Build development client** (I can guide you)

The core features (vision AI, image upload, TTS) are all working!
