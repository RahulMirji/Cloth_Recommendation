## Fixed Issues

### Issue 1: Profile Data Not Showing
**Root Cause**: ProfileScreen was using `authStore` which was never initialized, while profile data was being loaded into `AppContext`

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated ProfileScreen to use `useApp()` hook from AppContext instead of `authStore`
- Added fallback profile creation for legacy users
- Added better logging for debugging

**Files Modified**:
- `screens/ProfileScreen.tsx`
- `store/authStore.ts`
- `contexts/AppContext.tsx`

### Issue 2: Home Screen Showing "Guest"
**Root Cause**: HomeScreen was using `useUserProfile()` from uninitialized `authStore`

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated HomeScreen to use `useApp()` hook from AppContext
- Added profile image loading with error handling
- Added detailed logging

**Files Modified**:
- `screens/HomeScreen.tsx`

### Issue 3: History Not Loading Details
**Root Cause**: Outfit scorer wasn't properly loading history data from Supabase

**Fix Applied**:
- Added detailed logging to track history loading
- Improved error handling in `getChatHistoryById`
- Fixed session dependency in useEffect
- Added conversation_data parsing

**Files Modified**:
- `app/outfit-scorer.tsx`
- `utils/chatHistory.ts`
- `screens/history/OutfitHistoryList.tsx`
